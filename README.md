# SVM
KU Graduate School Paper Topic: Bivariate SVM classifier based on B-spline activation function

## SVM Process


### Side project
**Topic: SDLU simulation on different number of nodes**
 1. Compare fit depending on the number of nodes without constraint on width of activation function
 2. Compare fit depending on the number of nodes **with constraint** on width of activation function
 3. Compare fit depending on the number of nodes with cstraint on width of activation function and **residual fitting**
 4. Residual fitting with lasso penalty(lambda is chosen randomly)
 5. Residual fitting with lasso penalty, lambda sequence given.(Choose optimal lambda with the smallest BIC)
